GolfGod Project Sprints

What You Have Built (Phase 0 - Day 1 ✅)

Core System Components:

1. Data Collectors - Ready to scrape PGA Tour results, weather data, and import odds
2. Database - SQLite setup with models for players, tournaments, weather, odds, and backtest results

3. Backtesting Framework - Three betting strategies implemented:


    - Weather Edge (exploits market's undervaluation of wind impact)
    - Form Momentum (recent performance prediction)
    - Course Fit (historical course performance)

4. ROI Calculator - Statistical validation with p-values, Sharpe ratio, confidence intervals
5. GitHub Repository - Successfully pushed to https://github.com/ThomasJMcGovern/GolfGod

Project Goal: Prove a 3-5% ROI edge exists in golf betting markets before building complex
infrastructure.

📋 What's Next According to Plan

TODAY (Remaining Tasks):

1. Test remaining modules (30 min)
   python -m src.collectors.odds_importer
   python -m src.backtesting.roi_calculator
   python -m src.backtesting.strategy
2. Connect with Co-founder (1 hour)


    - Show them src/backtesting/strategy.py
    - Ask for historical odds data (CSVs, screenshots, anything)
    - Validate the 3 strategies and Kelly criterion (currently 25% fractional Kelly)
    - Get their input on minimum edge (currently 5%)

TOMORROW (Day 2 - Critical):

Morning: Real Data Collection

- Implement actual PGA Tour scraping (currently just skeleton)
- Target: 2024 tournament results (at least 10-15 tournaments)
- Get player scores, finishing positions

Afternoon: Historical Data

- Collect weather for those tournaments using weather_collector
- Manual odds collection with co-founder's help

Days 3-4: First Backtest

- Run all 3 strategies on real data
- Calculate actual ROI
- Identify which strategy shows promise

Days 5-7: Go/No-Go Decision

Success Criteria:

- ✅ if ROI > 3% after vig
- ✅ if p-value < 0.05 (statistically significant)
- ✅ if we have 50+ tournaments analyzed
- ❌ if no edge found → pivot or abandon

🚨 Critical Path Items

Must-Have Data (Priority Order):

1. Tournament Results - PGA Tour leaderboards (free to scrape)
2. Historical Odds - Most critical! Need from co-founder or manual collection
3. Weather Data - Already working with Open-Meteo API

Why This Week Matters:

- We're testing if the fundamental hypothesis is valid
- No point building infrastructure if there's no edge
- Need statistical proof before investing more time/money

Your Action Items:

1. Run the test commands above
2. Set up daily 15-min sync with co-founder
3. Start thinking about simple React dashboard for visualizing results
4. Document any decisions in docs/Context_Management_Template.md

Key Question to Answer: "Can we consistently beat the market by 3-5% using weather, form, and course
fit data?"

If yes → Phase 1 (automated pipeline)
If no → Pivot strategies or close project

The entire week is about proving or disproving this edge exists. Everything else is secondary.
