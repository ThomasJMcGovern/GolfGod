## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Decisions

### Tech Stack (Locked for MVP)

```
Language: Python 3.11
Database: PostgreSQL 15 + TimescaleDB
API: FastAPI
Cache: Redis
Deploy: Docker Compose ‚Üí DigitalOcean
```

### Why These Choices

- PostgreSQL: Powerful analytics with materialized views

## üìä Data Schema

### Core Tables

```sql
-- Players
CREATE TABLE players (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    pga_tour_id VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE
);

-- Tournaments
CREATE TABLE tournaments (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    course_id INTEGER,
    start_date DATE,
    purse DECIMAL(10,2)
);

-- Rounds
CREATE TABLE rounds (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    tournament_id INTEGER REFERENCES tournaments(id),
    player_id INTEGER REFERENCES players(id),
    round_num INTEGER,
    score INTEGER,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Weather
CREATE TABLE weather_observations (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    tournament_id INTEGER REFERENCES tournaments(id),
    observation_time TIMESTAMPTZ,
    temp_f DECIMAL(5,2),
    wind_mph DECIMAL(5,2),
    wind_direction INTEGER,
    conditions VARCHAR(50)
);
```

## üîß Key Algorithms

### Monte Carlo Simulation

```
1. Get player skill distributions (mean, std dev)
2. Add course/weather adjustments
3. Run 10,000 tournaments:
   - Sample each player's score from distribution
   - Rank players
   - Track finishing positions
4. Calculate probabilities from frequencies
```

### Feature Engineering Priority

1. **Strokes Gained** (vs field last 20 rounds)
2. **Course Fit** (performance at similar courses)
3. **Current Form** (weighted recent results)
4. **Weather Performance** (scoring in wind/cold)

## üìà Model Performance Targets

### Minimum Viable Model

- ROI: >3% after vig
- Top-10 Accuracy: >65%
- Winner Accuracy: >8%
- Calibration: Within 5% of predicted probs

### Stretch Goals

- ROI: >7%
- Live betting edge: >2%
- Head-to-head accuracy: >55%

## üöÄ Current Sprint Tasks

### Phase 0 Checklist

- [x] Set up development environment
- [x] Create project structure
- [x] Build data collectors (PGA, weather, odds)
- [x] Implement backtesting framework
- [x] Create ROI calculator with statistical validation
- [x] Load 2024 PGA Tour tournament list (34 tournaments)
- [ ] Scrape actual tournament results (currently using sample data)
- [ ] Get historical weather for tournaments
- [ ] **CRITICAL: Find closing odds data from co-founder**
- [ ] Run full backtest on 50+ tournaments
- [ ] Calculate actual ROI
- [ ] Document edge sources

### Next Sprint Planning

If Phase 0 shows edge > 3%:

- Set up PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB
- Build automated scrapers
- Design feature tables

## üêõ Known Issues & Solutions

### Data Quality

- **Problem**: PGA Tour site changes HTML frequently
- **Solution**: Use multiple selectors, add monitoring

### Rate Limiting

- **Problem**: Weather API has 1000 calls/day limit
- **Solution**: Cache aggressively, batch requests

### Model Overfitting

- **Problem**: Too many features, not enough data
- **Solution**: Start with 5-10 features max

## üìù Code Patterns

### Async Data Collection

```python
async def collect_data():
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        # Always add timeout and retry logic
        response = await client.get(url, timeout=30)
        return response.json()
```

### Database Best Practices

```python
# Always use connection pools
# Always use parameterized queries
# Always handle connection errors
async with db_pool.acquire() as conn:
    await conn.execute(query, *params)
```

### Feature Calculation

```sql
-- Always use materialized views for expensive calcs
-- Always add indexes on join columns
-- Always timestamp when refreshed
```

## üí≠ Design Philosophy

### Core Principles

1. **Ship beats perfect** - Get to paper trading ASAP
2. **Measure everything** - Data wins arguments
3. **Simple scales** - Complexity kills projects
4. **Edge first** - Without edge, nothing matters

### What We're NOT Building (Yet)

- Mobile app
- Social features
- Multiple sports
- Real-time shot tracking
- AI commentary

## üìÖ Progress Log

### Day 1 (2024-12-07)

- ‚úÖ Set up development environment (resolved Python 3.13 compatibility)
- ‚úÖ Created complete project structure
- ‚úÖ Built all core modules (scrapers, database, backtesting)
- ‚úÖ Set up GitHub repository (https://github.com/ThomasJMcGovern/GolfGod)
- ‚úÖ Loaded 34 PGA Tour tournaments for 2024
- ‚úÖ Created Jupyter notebook for data exploration
- ‚úÖ Tested all modules successfully

**Key Decisions Made:**
- Using SQLite for Phase 0 (easy migration to Supabase later)
- Starting with 3 strategies: Weather Edge, Form Momentum, Course Fit
- Conservative Kelly fraction (25%) for bet sizing
- 5% minimum edge threshold

**Tomorrow's Priority:**
- Connect with co-founder for historical odds data
- Start collecting real tournament results
- Begin weather data collection for tournaments

### Day 2 (Planned)

- [ ] Morning: Co-founder sync on betting strategies
- [ ] Collect real PGA Tour results (10+ tournaments)
- [ ] Match weather data to tournaments
- [ ] Evening: First backtest attempt

### Day 3-7

- [ ] To be planned based on Day 2 results
